### Installing Visual Studio and Compiling the Project

Sometimes it is necessary to compile from Visual Studio:

1. Download the newest version of Visual Studio: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/
2. Community Edition is fine for this project.
3. Open the installer.
4. Make sure to enable "Game development withC++" Workload. And then include "Unreal Engine installer" and "Windows 10 SDK" in its options on the right side of the Installer's Window.
5. You might need to right-click the `OdinUnrealSample.uproject` file and `Generate Visual Studio project files`.
6. Double-click the `OdinUnrealSample.uproject`
7. It should compile automatically now. If this does not work, open the `OdinUnrealSample.sln` file instead.
8. Visual Studio will open.
9. Once done hit F5 to start the debugger - and compile using Visual Studio.
